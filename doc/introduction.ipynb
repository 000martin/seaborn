    "Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and closely integrated with `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some of the functionality that seaborn offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset-oriented API for examining :ref:`relationships <different_scatter_variables>` between :ref:`multiple variables <faceted_lineplot>`\n",
    "- Specialized support for plotting :ref:`observations <jitter_stripplot>` or aggregate :ref:`statistics <pointplot_anova>` within categorical groupings \n",
    "- Options for visualizing of :ref:`univariate <distplot_options>` or :ref:`bivariate <joint_kde>` distributions and for :ref:`comparing <horizontal_boxplot>` them between subsets of data\n",
    "- Automatic estimation and plotting of :ref:`linear regression <anscombes_quartet>` models for different kinds :ref:`dependent <logistic_regression>` variables\n",
    "- Fast views onto the overall :ref:`structure <scatterplot_matrix>` of complex datasets\n",
    "- High-level abstractions for structuring :ref:`multi-plot grids <faceted_histogram>` that let you easily build :ref:`complex <pair_grid_with_kde>` visualizations\n",
    "- Concise control over matplotlib figure styling with several :ref:`built-in themes <aesthetics_tutorial>`\n",
    "- Tools for choosing :ref:`color palettes <palette_tutorial>` that faithfully reveal patterns in your data\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. The API is \"dataset-oriented\" because the plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing a whole dataset and internally perform the necessary mapping to semantic variables and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. Here's an example of what this means:"
