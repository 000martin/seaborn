However, what if one of the main variables you are interested in is categorical? In this case, the scatterplot and regression model approach won't work. There are several options, however, for visualizing such a relationship, which we will discuss in this tutorial.\n",

    "It's useful to divide seaborn's categorical plots into three groups: those that show each observation at each level of the categorical variable, those that show an abstract representation of each *distribution* of observations, and those that apply a statistical estimation to show a measure of central tendency and confidence interval. The first includes the functions :func:`swarmplot` and :func:`stripplot`, the second includes :func:`boxplot`, :func:`violinplot` and :func:`lvplot`, and the third includes :func:`barplot` and :func:`pointplot`. These functions all share a basic API for how they accept data, although each has specific parameters that control the particulars of the visualization that is applied to that data.\n",

    "Much like the relationship between :func:`regplot` and :func:`lmplot`, in seaborn there are both relatively low-level and relatively high-level approaches for making categorical plots. The functions named above are all low-level in that they plot onto a specific matplotlib axes. There is also the higher-level :func:`factorplot`, which combines these functions with a :class:`FacetGrid` to apply a categorical plot across a grid of figure panels.\n",
