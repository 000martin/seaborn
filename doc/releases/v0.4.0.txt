v0.4.0 (??)
-----------

Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The rules for choosing default color palettes when variables are mapped to different colors have been unified (and thus changed in some cases). Now when no specific palette is requested, the current global color palette will be used, unless the number of variables to be mapped exceeds the number of unique colors in the palette, in which case the ``"husl"`` palette will be used to avoid cycling.

- Added a keyword argument ``hist_norm`` to :func:`distplot`. When a :func:`distplot` is now drawn without a KDE or parametric density, the histogram is drawn as counts instead of a density. This can be overridden by by setting ``hist_norm`` to ``True``.

- Made some changes to :func:``factorplot`` so that it behaves better when not all levels of the ``x`` variable are represented in each facet.

- Added the ``logx`` option to :func:`regplot` for fitting the regression in log space.

Style and color palettes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the :func:`cubehelix_palette` function for generating sequential palettes from the cubehelix system. See the :ref:`palette docs <cubehelix_palettes>` for more information on how these palettes can be used. There is also the :func:`choose_cubehelix` which will launch an interactive app to select cubehelix parameters in the notebook.

- Added the :func:`xkcd_palette` and the ``xkcd_rgb`` dictionary so that colors :ref:`can be specified <using_xkcd_palettes>` with names from the `xkcd color survey <http://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/>`_.

- Added the ``font_scale`` option to :func:`plotting_context`, :func:`set_context`, and :func:`set`. ``font_scale`` can independently increase or decrease the size of the font elements in the plot.

- The :func:`despine` function gets a new keyword argument ``offset``, which replaces the deprecated :func:`offset_spines` function. You no longer need to offset the spines before plotting data.

- Added a default value for ``pdf.fonttype`` so that text in PDFs is editable in Adobe Illustrator.

Other API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed the deprecated ``set_color_palette`` and ``palette_context`` functions. These were replaced in version 0.3 by the :func:`set_palette` function and ability to use :func:`color_palette` directly in a ``with`` statement.

- Removed the ability to specify a ``nogrid`` style, which was renamed to ``white`` in 0.3.
