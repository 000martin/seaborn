-------------------

- Fixed a problem where the :class:`FacetGrid` or :class:`PairGrid` legend remained inside the figure when using ``legend_out=True`` on an interactive backend.

- Fixed an bug in :func:`clustermap` when using ``yticklabels=False``.

- Improved robustness of :func:`kdeplot` and :func:`distplot` to data with fewer than two observations.

- In categorical plot functions with small plot elements, use :func:`dark_palette` instead of :func:`light_palette` to generate colors when both ``hue`` and ``color`` are specified.

- Fixed an issue in :func:`pointplot` where colors were wrong if exactly three points were being drawn.

- Fixed an issue in :func:`pointplot` where legend entries for missing data appeared with empty markers.
