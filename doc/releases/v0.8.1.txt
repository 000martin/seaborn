v0.8.1 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- Added a warning in :class:`FacetGrid` when passing a categorical plot function without specifying ``order`` (or ``hue_order`` when ``hue`` is used), which is likely to produce a plot that is incorrect.

- Fixed a problem where the :class:`FacetGrid` or :class:`PairGrid` legend remained inside the figure when using ``legend_out=True`` on an interactive backend.

- Fixed an bug in :func:`clustermap` when using ``yticklabels=False``.

- Improved robustness of :func:`kdeplot` and :func:`distplot` to data with fewer than two observations.

- In categorical plot functions with small plot elements, use :func:`dark_palette` instead of :func:`light_palette` to generate colors when both ``hue`` and ``color`` are specified.

- Fixed an issue in :func:`pointplot` where colors were wrong if exactly three points were being drawn.

- Fixed an issue in :func:`pointplot` where legend entries for missing data appeared with empty markers.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`clustermap` where an error was raised when annotating the main heatmap and showing category colors.

- Fixed an issue in :func:`clustermap` where row labels were not being properly rotated when they overlapped.

- Improved compatibility with future versions of pandas.
