v0.5.1 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- Implemented a workaround for a bug in matplotlib 1.4.2 that prevented point markers from being drawn when the seaborn styles had been set. See this `github issue <https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/344>`_ for more information.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`heatmap` where the mask was vertically reversed relative to the data.
