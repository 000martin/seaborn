v0.8.0 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- Added the ``dodge`` argument to :func:`boxplot`, :func:`violinplot`, and :func:`barplot` to allow use of ``hue`` without changing the position or width of the plot elements, as when the ``hue`` varible is not nested within the main categorical variable.

- Added the ability to draw a colorbar for a bivariate :func:`kdeplot` with the ``cbar`` parameter (and related ``cbar_ax`` and ``cbar_kws`` parameters).

- Allow side-specific offsets in :func:`despine`.

- Put a cap on the number of bins used in :func:`jointplot` for ``type=="hex"`` to avoid hanging when the reference rule prescribes too many.

- Turn off dendrogram axes in :func:`clustermap` rather than setting the background color to white.

- New matplotlib qualitative palettes (e.g. "tab10") are now handled correctly.
