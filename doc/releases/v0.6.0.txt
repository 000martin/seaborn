v0.6.0 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- Added the ``line_kws`` parameter to :func:`residplot` to change the style of the lowess line, when used.

- Added an entry to the default style that makes legend backgrounds translucent, which looks better if the legend has to be placed over other plot elements.

- Added a catch in :func:`distplot` when calculating a default number of bins. For highly skewed data it will now use 10 bins, where previously the reference rule would return "infinite" bins and cause an exception in matplotlib.
