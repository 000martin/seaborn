v0.9.0 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- Added the :func:`scatterplot` function for representing the relationship between ``x`` and ``y``, potentially after conditioning on up to three other variables and semantically mapping those conditions with the color, size, or style of the points.

- Added the :func:`lineplot` function for representing relationships between``x`` and ``y`` variables with lines, potentially after conditioning on up to three other variables and semantically mapping those conditions with the color, size, or style of the lines. This function replaces :func:`tsplot`, but with an API that is more consistent with other modern seaborn functions and has both more flexibility (more dimensions of semantic mapping, better handling of dates) and less flexibility (fewer options for visual representing uncertainty). There is considerable new API documentation and a few gallery examples.

- Final removal of the previously-deprecated ``coefplot`` and ``interactplot`` functions.

- Deprecated the statistical annotation component of :class:`JointGrid`. The method is still available but will be removed in a future version.

- Fixed :func:`jointplot`/:class:`JointGrid` and :func:`regplot` so that they now accept list inputs.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`FacetGrid` when using a single row/column level or using ``col_wrap=1``.

- Changed :func:`rugplot` to plot a matplotlib ``LineCollection`` instead of many ``Line2D`` objects, providing a big speedup for large arrays.

- Added the ``subplot_kws`` parameter to :class:`PairGrid` for more flexibility.

- Enhanced :func:`color_palette` to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a string, prefixed with ``"ch:"`` (e.g. ``"ch:-.1,.2,light=.7"``). This will be accepted by any seaborn function with a ``palette=`` parameter.

- Changed the default diagonal plots in :func:`pairplot` to use :func:`kdeplot` and changed the default off-diagonal plots to use :func:`scatterplot`.

- Removed a special case in :class:`PairGrid` that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes.

- Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0.

- Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF).

- Changed the install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that ``pip`` is aware of. This means that ``pip install seaborn`` will now work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict minimal versions.

- Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>` (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).
