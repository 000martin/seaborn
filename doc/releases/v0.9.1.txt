v0.9.1 (Unreleased)
------------------

This is a minor release, comprising mostly bug fixes and compatibility with dependency updates.

- Fixed an issue where :func:`regplot` could interfere with other axes in a multi-plot matplotlib figure.

- Semantic variables with a ``category`` data type will always be treated as categorical in relational plots.

- Avoided a warning about color specifications that arose from :func:`boxenplot` on newer matplotlibs.

- Fixed a bug when setting the rotation of x tick labels on a :class:`FacetGrid`.
